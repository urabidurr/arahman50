Questions:
  What are the advantages of using recursion over iteration in JavaScript?
  Are there specific scenarios where recursion is preferred?
Comments:
  It's important to ensure that the base case is defined to avoid infinite recursion.
Concerns:
  Recursive functions can lead to performance issues, especially with large datasets or deep recursion levels. How will we tackle sorting while making the app run smoothly?
