Disco:
To clear a table, you can use the command DELETE FROM (name) in order to clear the table,
since tables add up each time you run the program, without clearing.
You can execute multiple times as an individual command, and when you commit, your
commands save and your file saves, and when you close it, it cannot take anymore inputs.
You can use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS (name) (parameters with type and name) in order
to make a new table with custom values, and when used in a command, will create a table
that you can add values into.
csv.DictReader(file) can basically turn your csv into a set of dicts.
csv.DictReader(file).fieldnames can give the column names for your csv file as an array.
You can use INSERT INTO (name) VALUES (values) to insert values underneath a column which
should be in the format of '(value 1, value 2, value 3)' for each thing you input.
You can use db.commit() to save the changes that you made with executing, so nothing after
that commit stage will be saved.
You can use SELECT (values) FROM (name) to select all the values in the table. These values
are relative to the column name, and can be removed or changed in order and will still work
fine.
You can use .fetchall() with the selected values to gather all those values, which allows
you to print it out.
You can close the database with .close() to not allow any commits or executions to happen.
