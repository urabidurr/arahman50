## K22: Testing On-Ramps + Other FEFs
### Due: 2024-11-20w before class

_Step 0: Establish team comms. Fetch KtS._

#### Your MISSION: 
As a duo, select 2 other nearby teams' front-end framework on-ramps and use them to come up to speed on each.

#### TASK
* make a website, 
* using each other's framework, 
* to share with the world some easily-generated content of your choosing (suggestion: What have the duckies in your neighbourhood been up to lately?).

--- 

##### Specifications/Guidelines:
* In your heading, replace your name with your TNPG and roster.
* Display team name and roster on rendered page.
* _Nota bene: The DOCTYPE tag in your html file, if present, must be the first line. So insert your heading comment immediately after._
* Note anything notable in readme. Include these section headings with corresponding content:
  - DISCO
  - QCC
  - q0 (Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp? Your answer should be a single binary digit.)
  - q0b If answer to preceding question is 1, cite all resources consulted -- including verbal consultations and/or neighbouring team's readme. 1citation/line.)
  - q1 (_only to be answered after you have finished..._ At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.)
* _Reminder:_ include heading as comment in any source code you create.
<br>

##### PROTIPS:
* _Simplicity is divine_.
* Use Q&A forum liberally.
* Use your browser's developer console...
  - Have it open while you work.
  - Note anything notable. Share with DevoFam.
* Comment liberally in-line. Speak to your future self and/or future teammates.

##### DELIVERABLES:
* Save to workshop as indicated. (Example below applies to a team who wrote a tailwind on-ramp.)
* `index.html` will be considered your official submission, as before. You may include additional backups, as before.

   Bootstrap 

    DISCO:

    The syntax for Bootstrap is very similar to Tailwind. To style an element, you declare the class name in the html along with what you what to style in the quotations.
    
    QCC:

    What does integrity and cross origin mean when you are setting up bootstrap cdn?
    
    q0 (Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp? Your answer should be a single binary digit.): 0
    
    q0b If answer to preceding question is 1, cite all resources consulted -- including verbal consultations and/or neighbouring team's readme. 1citation/line.):
    
    q1 (only to be answered after you have finished... At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.):

    I still prefer Tailwind because the styling lingo is a lot more intuitive than Bootstrap, but I appreciate Bootstrap for being more flexible and displaying datas and tables, which could be useful when you are working with databases.
