Bootstrap 

    DISCO:

    The syntax for Bootstrap is very similar to Tailwind. To style an element, you declare the class name in the html along with what you what to style in the quotations.
    
    QCC:

    What does integrity and cross origin mean when you are setting up bootstrap cdn?

    I still prefer Tailwind because the styling lingo is a lot more intuitive than Bootstrap, but I appreciate Bootstrap for being more flexible and displaying datas and tables, which could be useful when you are working with databases.

  Foundation 

    DISCO:

    The 12-column grid system allowed for easy layout adjustments, while pre-styled components like buttons and modals saved time. The built-in JavaScript plugins, such as the off-canvas menu, added interactivity     
    with minimal effort.

    I prefer Foundation over Tailwind CSS for this project. Foundationâ€™s responsive grid and ready-to-use components allowed for faster implementation. Its accessibility features ensured a better user experience, 
    making it a practical choice for our needs.
