## K22: Testing On-Ramps + Other FEFs
### Due: 2024-11-20w before class

_Step 0: Establish team comms. Fetch KtS._

#### Your MISSION: 
As a duo, select 2 other nearby teams' front-end framework on-ramps and use them to come up to speed on each.

#### TASK
* make a website, 
* using each other's framework, 
* to share with the world some easily-generated content of your choosing (suggestion: What have the duckies in your neighbourhood been up to lately?).

--- 

##### Specifications/Guidelines:
* In your heading, replace your name with your TNPG and roster.
* Display team name and roster on rendered page.
* _Nota bene: The DOCTYPE tag in your html file, if present, must be the first line. So insert your heading comment immediately after._
* Note anything notable in readme. Include these section headings with corresponding content:
  - DISCO
  - QCC
  - q0 (Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp? Your answer should be a single binary digit.)
  - q0b If answer to preceding question is 1, cite all resources consulted -- including verbal consultations and/or neighbouring team's readme. 1citation/line.)
  - q1 (_only to be answered after you have finished..._ At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.)
* _Reminder:_ include heading as comment in any source code you create.
<br>

##### PROTIPS:
* _Simplicity is divine_.
* Use Q&A forum liberally.
* Use your browser's developer console...
  - Have it open while you work.
  - Note anything notable. Share with DevoFam.
* Comment liberally in-line. Speak to your future self and/or future teammates.

##### DELIVERABLES:
* Save to workshop as indicated. (Example below applies to a team who wrote a tailwind on-ramp.)
* `index.html` will be considered your official submission, as before. You may include additional backups, as before.
